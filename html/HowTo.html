                One of my first cameras I ever owned was a 3D film camera. These cameras were first introduced in the 1980’s
                 and all hold a unique characteristic of having 2-4 lenses on their body, resembling an insect or bug.

                <h3>3 LENS</h3> 
                <h3>3 PHOTOS</h3>
                <p id="p2">
                    The camera I own is called the RETO-3D which is a modern remake of these cameras. When looking inside of the camera, you can see that the lens captures images in portrait format but are divided up into 3. Each image covers ½ a frame, meaning 3 photos that make up a 3D photo covers 1½ frames. Thus a roll of 36 exposures will give you 24 3D photos and a roll of 24 exposures will give you 18 photos. 

So how do you use these cameras and then create the 3D effect with film?
